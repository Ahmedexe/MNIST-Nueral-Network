# MNIST-Nueral-Network

### Abstract
The project is a simple neural network used to recognize hand-written digits using ONLY NUMPY and other helping modules like pandas and matplotlib

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
- The csv file for the training and testing data are greater in size of what the repository could handle, so I didn't commit it.
